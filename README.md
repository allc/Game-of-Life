# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life implemented with html canvas.

Demo: <https://allc.github.io/Game-of-Life/>

## Note
In this implementation, the size of the world is limited, and cells can not be alive outside the boundary.

## TODO
* Allow to change the size of the world.
* Allow to draw your own world and to have some predefined worlds.
* Add world export and import.
* Add world import by uploading the image of the world (hopefully).
